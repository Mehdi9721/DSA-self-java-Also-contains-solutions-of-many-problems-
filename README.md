## Linked List
Linked list is a non contigues memory allocation technique, a node is associated and next node address is assigned to every node. <br>

#### Node

Node is a object which store value,next address inside it. <br>
we can initialise multiple values on a single node, (2->3->4->5->6) <br>
2 is a node which has address of 3 <br>
3 has address of 4 and so on <br>


#### LinkedList Node always ponit to address while values stored in node.
Linked is an ADT which can store unlimited node in it.

### question approaches ->
1=> use slow and fast pointer for cycle findig, slow=node.next while fast=node.next.next <br>
2=> To find where the cycle is started first just create a new pointer from head and move the pointer from next from the meating point (where they was meated while finding the cycle).<br>





## misc (HashMap)
we create a hashmap using array also.<br>
fill array elements with -1 and add remove or delete as per need. <br>
## misc number game
any number for finding greatest sum by adding to original number and other this type of problems can be solved by using two magical numbers which is "2" and "3".
## misc Stack
stack can be implemented by using Array,dynamic Array and LinkedList. <br>
# Misc StringBuilder
String is immutable in java hence we use StringBuilder class for easier revering a string. StringBuilder class has methods of reverse(),toString()=>for converting into string, we use append() method for adding character 1 by 1 inside the StringBuilder.
