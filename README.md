## Linked List
Linked list is a non contigues memory allocation technique, a node is associated and next node address is assigned to every node. <br>

#### Node
Node is a object which store value,next address inside it. <br>
we can initialise multiple values on a single node, (2->3->4->5->6) <br>
2 is a node which has address of 3 <br>
3 has address of 4 and so on <br>


#### LinkedList Node always ponit to address while values stored in node.
Linked is an ADT which can store unlimited node in it.

### question approaches ->
1= use slow and fast pointer for cycle findig, slow=node.next while fast=node.next.next <br>

{
## misc (HashMap)
we create a hashmap using array also.
fill array elements with -1 and add remove or delete as per need.

}
